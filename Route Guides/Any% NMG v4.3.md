No Major Glitches Speedrun v4.3: Male/Female Scout -> Jedi Guardian Route (Light Side)[/big]**[/center]

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible without major glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends on the last hit on Malak.  A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.  This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the KotOR Speedrunning Discord which is linked on the game's sidebar on speedrun.com.  There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

[section=Character Build]

***Character Creation***

We begin as a Scout; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, but Male has the small advantage of an easier time sparing Bastila on the Star Forge with successful Persuade checks.  

Scout is used because it is guaranteed an Adrenal Alacrity in the initial footlocker on Endar Spire, which saves 12 seconds by enabling us to run faster earlier on Taris, and skip shopping with Zelka.  On becoming a Jedi we'll choose the Jedi Guardian class for maximum attack power, the Force Jump feat, and since we no longer need any skill points.

**Initial Attributes:**
Str - 18
Dex - 14
Con - 14
Int - 10
Wis - 8
Cha - 8

**Initial Skills:**
Computer Use - 4
Security - 1
Treat Injury - 4
Save 2 points

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee

We are going to focus on melee attacks with a lightsaber, so we max out Strength immediately, and get enough Dexterity and Constitution to help us survive.  The final two points are put into Intelligence; that plus the 4 points in Computer Use saves us 1 computer spike for every hacking action, which is essential for our spike route on Taris.

Besides Computer Use, Treat Injury (TI) will be our secondary skill, with Persuade the main skill; however since Persuade is not a Class Skill for Scouts, we'll save points to put into Persuade once we become a Jedi.  The point in Security is for a door on the Endar Spire and serves no other purpose, but does save a few seconds.

We choose Weapon Focus: Melee for the attack boost on Taris, in particular the fights in the Sith Base.  We choose it over Two-Weapon Fighting because it takes longer to select, so at level 2 it's faster to pick Two-Weapon Fighting.  Since character creation isn't timed, this is optimal.

***Leveling Plan***

https://i.imgur.com/wTRPaP0.png

Our main combat plan is lots of Strength, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Master Flurry, and Knight Speed, using Bastila's Double-bladed Lightsaber as our main weapon.  This gives us multiple attacks that will deal as much damage as possible; we need as many attacks as we can get, since our chance to hit will be relatively low.  We are not guaranteed to hit level 11 in the run, but if we do it's best to just Auto-Level to get the +1 Attack bonus; we don't really need any additional skills or Force Powers at that point.  Other notes:

**Skill notes:**
- After the initial 4 points in Computer Use, we don't put any additional points in.  We would need to reach 8 to save additional spikes, and we don't have the skill points to spare.
- We need Persuade for four conversations:
1. On Dantooine, we must Persuade Juhani to return to the Jedi.
2. On Korriban, we must Persuade Shaardan to spare the hopefuls for Light Side points (LSP).
3. On Korriban, we must Persuade Yuthura to allow us to enter the academy.
4. On Korriban, we must Persuade Kel Alghwin to disclose his doubts to us.
- The rest is put into Treat Injury to make our medpac use more efficient.

**Feat notes:**
- Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons only gives us an attack boost on Taris, but that's where most of our fighting occurs, so it's a worthwhile feat to take.
- Empathy is chosen since there aren't other good feats at level 3, and it gives +1 to TI and +1 to Persuade, our two most important skills.
- Flurry and Two-Weapon Fighting are our main combat core.

**Force Power notes:**
- Force Speed is the most important Force power, giving double movement speed, although [Save Teleports](5dagb) are eventually the fastest form of movement.  Knight Speed also grants +1 attack per round, which is highly important due to our relatively low chance to hit.
- Force Valor is used on Korriban to increase chances of a successful Persuade on Yuthura, as well as to boost stats for as many fights as possible.  Knight Valor also gives us Immunity: Poison, which protects against Affliction and Plague on the Star Forge.
- Disable Droid is used to free the Captured Jedi during the Malak fight at the end of the game.  This denies them to Malak, meaning you only have to kill him twice.  It also fills up your Force Points as well, though not your health.
- Affect and Dominate Mind are used for the following:
1. Avoiding landing fees on Manaan, Tatooine, and Kashyyyk.
2. Persuading Lashowe to assist us in finding the holocron.
3. Persuading the Czerka guards in the Upper Shadowlands to give up the emitter codes.

[section=Equipment Plan]

**Implant: None**
- While we used to use the Nerve Enhancement Package for Immunity: Mind-Affecting, skipping Zelka means it's more convenient to nab the Nerve Amplifier Belt for that purpose.  The other implants we obtain are sold for significant and important credits.

**Head: Verpine Headband**
Found on Dantooine, Casus Sandral's corpse
- This is the most convenient mask to grab, giving +3 to our Will save, which is our weakest.

**Gloves: Strength Enhancer**
Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- This is used for the +1 Strength; from levels 4 through 7, it nets us an extra +1 modifier, which helps for the fight against Lashowe.

**Body: Jedi Knight Robe**
Found on Dantooine, Nemo's remains
- We want to wear robes to allow us to cast our Force powers, and this is the most convenient robe to grab, since we loot Nemo anyway for the Sigil crystal.

**Weapon: Double-bladed Lightsaber**
Found on Taris, Brejik's "corpse"
- We borrow Bastila's lightsaber for the run (and probably give it back afterwards).  The crystals we use are as follows:

Sigil Crystal: Placed after Tatooine, used for +1 Attack
Opila Crystal: The only other convenient crystal on our route.  The damage boost and massive critical hits makes it worthwhile.  Placed after Tatooine.
Solari Crystal: The best crystal in the game and the reason we try to stay Light-aligned (see below).  Replaces Opila after Korriban.

**Belt: Nerve Amplifier Belt**
Found on Tatooine, Chewed Twi'lek corpse
- Skipping the CNS belt streamlines the credit route and lets us skip the strongbox in the Vulkar Garage, saving about a minute at the expense of slightly worse combat.  The Nerve Amplifier Belt is a convenient replacement that preserves Immunity: Mind-Affecting and lets us skip Zelka on Taris for a little further timesave.

All of our equipment should be equipped once we leave Tatooine, with the exception of the Solari crystal which is placed after Korriban.  We'll also use the Combat Suit, Prototype Vibroblade and a basic Vibroblade while on Taris.

[section=Credits Route]

By skipping the CNS Strength Enhancer, we can concentrate all of our shopping into 3 to 5 trips, depending on how many safe strats we decide to use:

**1. Larrim on Taris**
*Sell*: Nonessential items to reach ~1182 Credits
*Buy*: 2 Concussion Grenades, 1 Frag Grenade, 1 Battle Stimulant (374 Credits)

**2. Zelka on Taris**
*Optional*: Buy 3x Adrenal Alacrity (150 Credits)

**3. Selkath Merchant on Manaan**
*Buy*: Advanced Medpac, Hyper Battle Stimulant, Hyper Adrenal Strength (380 Credits total)
*Buy*: Hyper Adrenal Alacrity **only** if you did not shop with Zelka (100 Credits)
*Optional:* Buy a second Hyper Battle Stimulant and second Hyper Adrenal Strength if you are *not* doing Krayt Skip (300 Credits)

**4. Mic'Tunan'Jus Orgu on Tatooine**
*Optional*: Buy Bantha Fodder **only** if you are *not* doing Krayt Skip (1 Credit)

**5. Czerka Shop on Korriban**
*Sell*: Nonessential items to reach ~4200 Credits
*Buy*: 20x Advanced Medpac, 5x Echani Battle Stimulant, 5x All Hyper Adrenal Stims (4100 Credits total)

Our credits all come from selling items we don't need, though we do loot some extra corpses to be able to afford all the stims we want on Korriban. The Selkath Merchant on Manaan is useful for the Adrenal Alacrity for the underwater segment, since we would normally skip Zelka.  The other stims are for the second phase of Leviathan Malak and the Sand People fight (if not doing Krayt Skip).

[section=Alignment Route]
Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark.  Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High).  The player character (Revan) can either be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light.  The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.

Here is the alignment route used in the run:

https://i.imgur.com/LFOrTDv.png

¤¤These actions are for some reason hardcoded to always give +3/-5 alignment, respectively.

There are two important points in this route:
1. We must be at 60 alignment or higher (the boundary between Neutral and Light) in order to equip any Light Side restricted equipment.  The Solari crystal is Light Side restricted, as well as being ridiculously good.  So we need to be at 60 alignment by the time we place the Solari Crystal (after Korriban) and stay there in order to keep our lightsaber equipped.

2. When Persuading Yuthura to allow us access to the Sith Academy, if we are at 61 or more alignment we will have a Persuade/Lie option in addition to the normal Persuade option.  The Persuade option is a Low Dark action and loses alignment, while Persuade/Lie is a neutral action.  While we used to try to reach 61 alignment before here, we use the Mid Light action of Persuading the Sith Thugs to counteract the Low Dark action of Persuading Yuthura genuinely.

However, wanting to equip the Solari crystal means we want to do mostly light side actions. Hence each dark side action we take is done for a specific and very good reason:
- Agreeing to kill Gadon Thek teleports you to entrance to the Vulkar Base, saving the 45 seconds it takes to run out of the base.
- Threatening Janice Nall to get T3 is the only way to obtain him, because we don't have the 2000 credits (and wouldn't want to spend them if we did).
- Persuading Yuthura is the fastest way into the Sith Academy (see above).
- Snitching on Kel Algwinn is part of the fastest way to gain the 5 necessary Prestige points on Korriban, and saves at least a minute over the next fastest option.

While we used to kill Freyyr in the Lower Shadowlands to enable a [Map CS Skip](rb685) to reach the Ebon Hawk, we can avoid the fight and its associated DSP by simply [Save Teleporting](5dagb) to the Wookiee Village and using a [Map CS Skip](rb685) from there.  This saves time and alignment issues.

[section=Route Overview]
This is a brief outline of the route for the Any% NMG run, including planet order and smaller skips:

**1. Taris**

* - Reach the Undercity and recruit Mission and Zaalbar to access Vulkar Base
* - Defense Turret Skip to access Vulkar Garage
* - Use Accelerator Warp to exit Vulkar Base
* - Skip the Brejik Fight to rescue Bastila 
* - Recruit T3 to access Sith Base
* - Kill the Sith Governor to get the Launch Codes
* - Steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris

**2. Dantooine**

* - Become a Jedi Padawan
* - Redeem Juhani to the light side
* - Find the Star Map in the ancient ruins

**3. Manaan**
* - Raid the Sith Base to recover the Data Module for the Republic
* - [Sonic Buffer](t5kyf#ch4Soft_Buffers) to skip the Mother Firaxan
* - Find the Star Map on the ocean floor

**4. Tatooine**

* - [Save Teleport](5dagb) into the Eastern Dune Sea
* - Kill the Krayt Dragon OR perform Krayt Skip to obtain the Star Map

**5. Korriban**

* - Inflitrate the Academy
* - Earn five prestige points with Uthar Wynn
* - Find the Star Map in Naga Sadow's Tomb

**6. Leviathan**

* - Rescue the crew using Mission
* - Skip the spacewalk sequence
* - Skip the Saul Karath fight
* - Defeat Darth Malak and escape

**7. Kashyyyk**

* - [Save Teleport](5dagb) to skip visiting the Wookiee Village
* - Recruit Jolee Bindo to access Lower Shadowlands
* - Find the Star Map in the Lower Shadowlands
* - [Save Teleport](5dagb) to the Wookiee Village to Return to the Ebon Hawk

**8. Unknown Planet**

* - Rescue the Elder Warrior and obtain Ship Parts
* - Use the Rakatan Ritual to enter the Ancient Temple
* - Defeat Bastila and stay true to the Light Side
* - Repair the Ebon Hawk and fly to the Star Forge

**9. Star Forge**

* - Find and kill Darth Malak

The reasoning for the middle planets:
- Manaan is first because there are no fights we have to win, and thus our relatively weak combat abilities don't matter as much.
- Tatooine is second because there's either no combat (if you do Krayt Skip), or we get the Krayt Dragon Pearl for a much-needed Attack bonus.
- Korriban is third so that we can get the Solari crystal; we also may have reached Level 9 (and Knight Speed) before Uthar and Yuthura to make those fights easier.  We also buy top-notch stims and medpacs here to make some later fights easier.
- Kashyyyk is done last because you can skip the Star Map computer's quiz if your identity has already been revealed, and our Save Teleports will be maximally effective here.

*For the rest of the Leviathan, you have to keep Carth and Bastila close to you in order to go through loading zones.  Do your best to make sure they don't wander off, as that can and will lose you a lot of time.  It can help to QS/QL here.*

Turn right and kill guard
- It's possible to run past this guard without killing him
- However, there's a small chance he'll shoot at Carth/Bastila and aggro them
Turn left at the end of the hall; make sure Carth and Bastila are following you here
Take first CLOSED door on left
Bash down armory door
Get the Space Suits from the floor
Exit the way you entered and take door on left

  - Done perfectly, you can run through the space section without any trouble

  - If that happens, QS/QL and you can open the door without donning the suit
Once on the other side: 
- Recast Knight Speed
- Carth uses Hyper Adrenal Alacrity
- Cast Burst of Speed on Bastila
- Activate Solo Mode
Have Carth and Bastila go through the door on the right
  - Tuck them in the corner to attempt to deaggro them

¤ Saul Karath skip
  - Before attempting, you may want to make a hard save for safety; you can softlock here.
  - This trick is a save buffer, but the timing is quite precise
  ¤ Open Bridge Door and QS twice
  - Load immediately
  - If the trick works, the bridge door will be open, the fight will not start, and Bastila and Carth will be in your party.
  - If Bastila and Carth are not in your party, you've softlocked.
  - If your last QS was too late, your game will crash when you load.
Once successful, hack bridge terminal: 1,2

Take left path, then right, then turn left
Hack computer terminal: 1,1,5
Return and take elevator to Command Deck

**Command Deck:**
¤ Immediately after loading, [Hard Buffer](t5kyf#ch3Hard_Buffers) to skip Bastila/Malak CS
Run/Force Jump until double doors
} Use rest of Hyper Stim Suite and Knight Speed/Valor if needed
¤ [Open Buffer](t5kyf#ch5Open_Buffers) into the triple Dark Jedi fight
- DO NOT Soft Buffer; you'll softlock if you do
- This Open Buffer messes with the Dark Jedi AI so they won't attack you unless you attack them first
Defeat three Dark Jedi to unseal the door
Darth Waifu fight
- *As a male MC with 12 Persuade and Empathy*, you can spam all conversations after the first
- *As a female MC or with less than 12 Persuade*, use the given conversations to guarantee sparing Bastila
- First conversation: 2
- First phase (use Flurry for all phases; try to make sure Speed stays active)
- Second conversation: 2, 2, 1
- Spam default action as you start the second phase to skip it
- If you fail to skip it, just attack Bastila
- Third conversation: 2, 2 (if you got the phase skip, this convo is also skipped)
- Do NOT spam default action here; if you talk to Bastila again, it's a softlock
- Defeat her last phase
- Last conversation *as a male character without enough Persuade*: 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
- Last conversation *as a female character*: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1
¤ Before the cutscene on the Harbinger, activate a [Map CS Skip](rb685):
  - Add two party members (one should be Jolee or Bastila, for Disable Droid)
  - Close the menu and watch the cutscene
> Auto-Level your party members
- If you hit Level 11, Auto-Level MC as well
¤ [Soft Buffer](t5kyf#ch4Soft_Buffers) to skip the Darth Malak conversation
  - To get to the elevator, run towards the corner near the left Jedi and rapidly switch party leaders
  - One of your characters will end up next to the elevator door; take it to the Viewing Platform

**Viewing Platform:**
Darth Malak fight:
  - Hit him until he triggers the Dead Jedi CS
  - Use Disable Droid with MC/Jolee/Bastila to release the remaining seven Dead Jedi
  - You can split the Jedi between MC and Jolee to save a little movement
  - Kill Malak once and for all
  - You have a backup Hyper Stim Suite if you need it; don't try to hit Malak without it, as your hit rate goes down 25% without stims active
  - You can also try to keep Knight Valor active (+10% to hit) but this is hard without duration glitch
