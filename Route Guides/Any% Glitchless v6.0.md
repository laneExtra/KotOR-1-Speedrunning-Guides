Any% Glitchless Guide v6.0: Male/Female Scout -> Jedi Guardian Route (Light Side)[/big]**[/center]

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible without the use of glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends on the last hit on Malak.  A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.  This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the KotOR Speedrunning Discord which is linked on the game's sidebar on speedrun.com.  There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

[section=Glitchless Rules]

All glitches are banned, with the exception of the following:
- Fast text (unavoidable without restarting the game frequently)
- Duration glitch (also unavoidable, and semirandom at this point in time)

In addition, exploits that give infinite experience, credits, or alignment points are also banned.

Due to its glitchy nature, QUICKSAVE is banned as well.  Manual and autosaves, however, are allowed.

[section=Character Build]

We begin as a Scout; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, but Male is potentially a few seconds faster since they have an easier time sparing Bastila on the Star Forge with successful Persuade checks.  Scout is used for the Implant Level 2 feat, as well as decent skill points and overall strength of saving throws.

On becoming a Jedi we'll choose the Jedi Guardian class for maximum attack power, the Force Jump feat, and since we no longer need any skill points.

**Initial Attributes**

Str - 18
Dex - 14/12
Con - 14
Int - 10
Wis - 8/10
Cha - 8

**Initial Skills**

Computer Use - 4
Stealth - 1
Treat Injury - 4
Save 2 skill points

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

We are going to focus on melee attacks with a lightsaber, so we max out Strength immediately, and get enough Dexterity and Constitution to help us survive.  Two points are put into Intelligence for enough skill points to get 4 net Computer Use; this saves one Computer Spike each time we hack something, and allows us to skip a fight.  Charisma is not needed; we'll get enough Persuade and the Empathy feat to guarantee nearly all the Persuade checks we try.  As an option, you can choose to put 12 in Dex and 10 in Wis; this gives a slightly better Will save and more Force points in exchange for a slightly weaker Reflex save and getting hit more often.  The lower Dex is really only relevant before Korriban, where medpac use is a little tight.

Treat Injury (TI) will be our main skill, with Persuade the secondary skill; however since Persuade is not a Class Skill for Scouts, we'll save points to put into Persuade once we become a Jedi.  We don't put any additional points into Computer Use after the initial 4; we'd need 8 total to save additional spikes, and we just don't need those extra spikes.  The point in Stealth guarantees our credit route for the early game; see below.

We choose Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons for the attack boost on Taris; we pick it over Two-Weapon Fighting because Weapon Focus takes longer to select, so at level 2 it's faster to pick Two-Weapon Fighting.  Since character creation isn't timed, this is optimal.

[big]***Leveling Plan***[/big]

https://i.imgur.com/TXzJ0hy.png

Our main combat plan is lots of Strength, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Master Flurry, and Knight Speed, using Bastila's Double-bladed Lightsaber as our main weapon.  This gives us multiple attacks that will deal as much damage as possible; we need as many attacks as we can get, since our chance to hit will be relatively low.  Other notes:

**Skill notes:** 
- Putting the point into Stealth at the start causes our initial footlocker to contain a Stealth Field Generator, which sells for 40 extra credits.  This is necessary to guarantee enough credits to buy the stims and computer spikes we want when we reach Taris.
- We need Persuade for five conversations:
1. We must Persuade Juhani in order to redeem her.
2. We must Persuade Shaardan to spare the hopefuls.
3. We must Persuade Yuthura to allow us to enter the academy.
4. We must Persuade Kel Algwinn to disclose his doubts to us.
5. We Persuade Bastila to return to the light side on the Star Forge.
The Yuthura Persuade check is the only one that we could fail with our build; it's a hard Persuade check done at level 7, so the 10 net Persuade we have gives us a 75% chance to pass the check.  It's a big time loss to fail it, so a safety save is recommended for nearly all runners.  After getting 10 in Treat Injury, we put the rest into Persuade so that we can pass a Persuade check with Bastila at the end to spare her.
- Aside from the four points in Computer Use at the start, every other spare point is put into Treat Injury to make our medpac use more efficient.

**Feat notes:**
- Empathy is chosen since there aren't other good feats at level 3, and it gives +1 to TI and +1 to Persuade, two of our main skills.  This and 10 Persuade also gives us a guaranteed pass for every Persuade check except Yuthura (see above).
- Implant Level 2 is automatically granted at level 4, and is used to equip the Nerve Enhancement Package for Immunity: Mind-Affecting.
- Flurry and Two-Weapon Fighting are our main combat core.

**Force Power notes:**
- Force Speed is the most important power, giving double movement speed.  With no Save Teleports, this is an essential power for the run.  Knight Speed also grants +1 attack per round, which is highly important due to our relatively low chance to hit.
- Force Valor is used once on Korriban to increase chances of a successful Persuade.  This also boosts stats and saving throws for sections of the Star Forge.
- Affect/Dominate Mind is used in the following places:
1. Affect Mind lets us enter Manaan and Tatooine without paying the 100 credit docking fee; this is important, since we will spend all of our credits before reaching that point.
2. Dominate Mind is required for a Force Persuade option on Lashowe.  Male characters can instead opt for the easier flirtatious Persuade option, but that requires 10 Charisma, and so you'd have to tweak your attributes or just use Force Valor.
3. Dominate Mind is used in the Upper Shadowlands to convince the guards to tell you the codes to the sonic emitters.  There is a normal Persuade option that can be passed with 10 Charisma, but it's simpler to Force Persuade, since we have Dominate Mind anyway.
- Energy Resistance is not particularly useful, but there aren't any worthwhile Force Powers to get at level 8.  Energy Resistance keeps our menus mostly uncluttered.
- Force Resistance is used to add a little extra protection for the fights on the Star Forge and the fight against Bastila on Lehon.  It's the only way to protect against certain effects, particularly the slow effect of a saved Stasis.
- Drain Life is used to drain the Corrupted Jedi during the final Malak fight, which not only denies them to Malak but also heals you fully.

[section=Equipment Plan]

*Implant: Nerve Enhancement Package*
Bought on Taris from Zelka Forn (500 Credits)
- Immunity: Mind-Affecting is highly important, as we will run past dozens of Dark Jedi during the run.  The NEP is the earliest and one of the cheapest ways to obtain it, and is a main reason to choose Scout for the run.

*Head: Verpine Headband*
Found on Dantooine, Casus Sandral's corpse
- The Verpine Headband is easily accessible and increases our weak Will save by 3, making it a convenient protection against certain Force powers.

*Gloves: Strength Enhancer*
Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- This is used for the +1 Strength; from levels 4 to 8 and at level 12, it nets us an extra +1 modifier.

*Body: Jedi Knight Robe*
Found on Dantooine, Nemo's remains
- We must use Robes to use our Force powers (mainly Speed), and this is the best convenient robe to get.  Optionally, you can loot a chewed Twi'lek corpse at the mouth of the Krayt Dragon cave for a Jedi Master Robe but the extra 1 defense really isn't worth it.

*Weapon: Double-bladed Lightsaber*
Found on Taris, Brejik's corpse
- We borrow Bastila's lightsaber for the run (and probably give it back afterwards).  The crystals we use are as follows:

Sigil Crystal: Placed after Dantooine, used for +1 Attack
Solari Crystal: The best crystal in the game and the reason we try to stay Light-aligned (see below).  Placed after Korriban and kept there for the entire run.
Krayt Dragon Pearl: Good damage boost, but essential for the +3 Attack boost.  Replaces the Sigil Crystal after Tatooine.

*Belt: Adrenaline Amplifier*
Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- Forgoing the CNS Strength Enhancer means there aren't really any good convenient belts to use.  We get this one for free and it bumps up our Reflex save a little bit.

All of our equipment should be equipped by the time we leave Dantooine, with the exception of the lightsaber crystals.  We'll also use the Combat Suit and various vibroblades while on Taris.

[section=Credits Route]

The new route has a very streamlined credit route, since we no longer need 8500 credits for the CNS Strength Enhancer.  Because of this, we make do with only 4 shopping trips during the run; there is a backup shopping trim if you're short on stims as well.  Our shopping is as follows:

*1. Larrim on Taris*
Sell: Nonessential items to reach ~1362 Credits
Buy: 2x Computer Spike (550 Credits total)

*2: Zelka Forn on Taris*
Buy: Nerve Enhancement Package, 6x Adrenal Alacrity (800 Credits total)

*3. Selkath Merchant on Manaan*
Buy: 2x Hyper-Adrenal Alacrity, 3x Hyper-Adrenal Strength (500 Credits total)
*While this can be skipped, it's a very fast shopping trip and the stims are very helpful.*

*4. Czerka Shop on Korriban*
Sell: Unneeded Items to reach ~7000 Credits
Buy: All Medpacs and Hyper/Echani Stimulants (6100 Credits total)

*Optional shopping if you are short on stims:*
*5: Eli Gand on Kashyyyk*
Buy: All Hyper Stims (500 Credits total)

We get most of our credits for the Korriban shopping trip from selling the Cardio Power System that we get as reward for completing "Mission for the Republic" for Roland Wann on Manaan.  The rest comes from selling the items we've accumulated up to that point; we loot one or two optional things to get enough credits for all the medpacs and stims we need.

[section=Alignment Route]

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark.  Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High).  The player character (Revan) can either be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light.  The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.

Here is the alignment route used in the run:

https://i.imgur.com/HqdJBBd.png

¤¤Snitching on Kel Algwinn is for some reason hardcoded to always give -5 alignment; similarly, rescuing the hopefuls from Shaardan is hardcoded to give +3 alignment.

There are two important points in this route:
1. We must be at 60 alignment or higher (the boundary between Neutral and Light) in order to equip any Light Side restricted equipment.  The Solari crystal is Light Side restricted, as well as being ridiculously good.  So we need to be at 60 alignment by the time we place the Solari Crystal (after Korriban) and stay there in order to keep our lightsaber equipped.

2. When Persuading Yuthura to allow us access to the Sith Academy, if we are at 61 or more alignment we will have a Persuade/Lie option in addition to the normal Persuade option.  The Persuade option is a Low Dark action and loses alignment, while Persuade/Lie is a neutral action.  It is important to be at 61 or more before entering this conversation, otherwise we would have to go out of our way on Korriban to be able to equip the Solari crystal at the end of the planet.

These two points combined mean we want to do mostly light side actions. Hence each dark side action we take is done for a specific and very good reason:
- Threatening Janice Nall to get T3 saves 2000 credits; otherwise we'd have to go out of our way to get them, wasting at least 30 seconds.
- Snitching on Kel Algwinn is part of the fastest way to gain the 5 necessary Prestige points on Korriban, and saves at least a minute over the next fastest option.

[section=Route Overview]

The order in which we visit planets is as follows:

Taris -> Dantooine -> Manaan -> Korriban -> Tatooine -> Leviathan -> Kashyyyk -> Unknown World -> Star Forge

The reasoning for the middle planets:
- Manaan is done first to give us enough credits to buy stims and medpacs when we first reach Korriban.  
- Korriban is second so that we can quickly Return to the Ebon Hawk after getting the Star Map; if done first or third, Calo or Bandon (respectively) get in the way of this.  We also get the Solari Crystal and buy top-notch stims and medpacs here to make some later fights easier.  
- Kashyyyk is done last because you can skip the Star Map computer's quiz if your identity has already been revealed.  We also don't need Jolee for the Leviathan rescue, since Canderous is fast enough.
- This leaves Tatooine as the third planet; this generally works out, as you can usually earn enough XP to have level 9 and Knight Speed leaving Korriban, making the fights with the Sand People quicker.

- If all three turrets are stunned, take the elevator to the Garage
- There is a 59.6% chance to stun all three turrets after *both* grenades.  Good luck!
- You MUST stun all three turrets, since we will be leaving this way.

- There is a chance the turrets will instantly kill you on the way out.  This seems to depend on how many times you've had to reload your safety saves; an even number will cause the turrets to shoot first, while an odd number will allow you to run past.
- Thus if you have reloaded an even number of times (including zero!), manually save and reload so that the turrets won't kill you.

Kill Brejik using poison/sonic grenades
- Start by running a little bit away so you don't get hit by your own grenades.
- Throw a Poison Grenade first, then two Sonic Grenades
- Brejik always gets hit by the poison, and the sonics have a 50-50 chance to do 10 or 20 damage.
- He has really high defense, so grenades are the best option
- Even if you don't roll 20s on the sonic grenades, the poison will eventually kill him

> Auto-Level Carth and Bastila
Activate Solo Mode
Take the elevator to Bridge: 2

*In the bridge section, you have to keep Carth and Bastila close to you in order to leave through the Bridge Storage door.  Do your best to make sure they don't wander off, as that can and will lose you a lot of time.  You can choose to manually save and reload that save; this sometimes helps.*

Turn right and kill or dodge guard at end

Take first CLOSED door on left
Bash down armory door
*Optional:* Loot front left plasteel cylinder for Thermal Detonators

} Equip Chieftain's Gaderffi Stick to Bastila
} Use Hyper-Stim Suite on MC
} Recast Knight Speed
*Optional:* Kill the five Sith Soldiers in the first room
- This safe strat makes leaving the Saul Karath fight more consistent, but wastes 20-30 seconds.
- You can use Solo Mode to run Bastila to the bridge door while MC and Carth clear out the soldiers, but wait until they're out of combat or you'll mess up the cutscene
Enter the bridge
Saul Karath fight:
- Force Jump to Saul or a Dark Jedi; take them out first
- If you looted the Thermals in the armory, have Carth and Bastila use them on the far Jedi/soldiers
- Otherwise, have Carth/Bastila concentrate on the soldiers behind them
- Keep a close eye on MC's health here, and use medpacs as necessary; you can let Carth/Bastila die
- Recast Knight Speed when it wears off (you'll be getting only three attacks per round instead of four)
- Clean up the Sith Soldiers once Saul falls
Saul Karath dies (+2 LSP; 62)
Hack bridge terminal: 1,2
Run through room and return to the Command Deck
- If you killed the first five Sith Soldiers, kill the Sith Grenadiers as you go so Carth and Bastila stay with you
- If you skipped the Sith Soldiers, use Solo Mode to maneuver everyone close enough to the exit to leave
- Using a Hyper Alacrity on Carth is recommended
- If Carth or Bastila die too far from the door, you'll have to kill all the Sith soldiers to leave
Once on the Command Deck, medpac anyone who needs it
- Again, you might want to manually save/load when reaching the main area to help Carth and Bastila stay with you
Take left path and loop around outside back to elevator
- You'll encounter 2-3 Sith Soldiers, 2 Dark Jedi, and 3-4 Sith Grenadiers
- Kill every last one of them to keep Carth and Bastila with you

Run/Force Jump towards North Beach
} Before entering North Beach, use Hyper-Stim Suite
Rakatan Warriors accost you
Speak with The One: 1,1,1,1,1,4,4
¤ Run to Elder Warrior and talk to him

Defeat three Dark Jedi to unseal the door
- The back one uses Force Wave, which is really annoying; try to take him out first.
Darth Waifu fight/conversation
  - Be careful not to spam default action during a conversation; this will skip a phase (a glitch!)
  - Use Flurry for all phases; try to make sure Speed stays active
  - All conversations can be spammed if you have 13 Persuade
  - If you have less than 13 Net Persuade, you can still spare Bastila with the following conversations:
  - *As a female character*: 2 | 2,2,1 | 2,2 | 1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1
  - *As a male character*: 2 | 2,2,1 | 2,2, | 1,1,1,3,2,3,1,1,1,1
