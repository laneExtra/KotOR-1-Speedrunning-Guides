Any% No Major Glitches v4.3 - Video Tutorial[/big]**[/center]

[center]Tutorials by indykenobi[/center]

[section=Introduction]

There are two video tutorials for Any% No Major Glitches:

- Overview Tutorial, done as part of the How to Train A Speedrunner GDQ Hotfix show
- Detailed Tutorial, done in eleven episodes

Both tutorials correspond to v4.3 of the [written guide](d8i6l), though there are significant differences in their approaches.  Both tutorials fully explain the glitches necessary to complete the run, so no prior knowledge is necessary before watching these tutorials (although knowing how to play KotOR is probably helpful).

If you have further questions, ask in the KotOR Speedrunning Discord linked above!



[section=Overview Tutorial]


This tutorial is aimed at beginners and does not cover some of the fastest strats; in particular, this tutorial uses backup strats in place of the Sewer GP Warps and Krayt Dragon Skip.  If you're just looking to get started with running Any% NMG, this is the one to watch!

Two notes:
- Though it was recorded when the written guide was in v4.0, this tutorial does correspond to v4.3 of the written guide if you use the backup/safe strats whenever the option presents itself.
- This tutorial was the third run of a set of three during the GDQ Hotfix show when it was recorded; while this video should start in the right place, there's also a chapter start at the beginning of the KotOR run.

[section=Detailed Tutorial]

This tutorial is split into 11 episodes, found in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOUtDgJwg14EzAFwNHcsnb9bwuriGD4Pe) or seen individually below.  Each episode covers all of the fastest strats for that segment, as well as the alternative and backup and safe strats.  Each new glitch is also covered in detail within the context of the speedrun.
