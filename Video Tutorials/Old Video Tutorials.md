[section=Introduction]

These are old video tutorials for KotOR speedrunning.  While their strategies may be old or obsolete, there is still some good information in these videos, so we're keeping them here.  Think of it like a tutorial retirement home!

[section=All Quests Unrestricted v2.2 - 1/9/2021 by indykenobi]

This is a video tutorial for the All Quests Unrestricted category of KotOR.  This tutorial aligns with version 2.2 of the [written guide](2setw) for All Quests Unrestricted.  See that guide for additional details about the route.

The video tutorial is split into 15 episodes, and exists in its entirety in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOkItSf_X-I&list=PLOUtDgJwg14F-oNebziBKpmzEmmijqAQT). The tutorial assumes knowledge of the common glitches used in the Unrestricted ruleset, including buffer glitches, hotshots, AMG, GP Warps, and others.

If you have questions, ask in the discord!

I really apologize for the sound glitches. It seems my microphone doesn't like sibilants.

Things I should have mentioned in the guide:

After exiting the sith base, you can equip Bastila with the sith armor to get through the guarded door to the lower city without waiting for the MC. Don't forget to unequip her otherwise you can't make it through the cantina door.

Even if a character is stunned, if you tab to another party member and tab back, you can have them perform an attack.
