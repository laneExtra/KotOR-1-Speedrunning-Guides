[center][big]***Map Cutscene Skips
-------------------------------***[/big][/center]

[section=Description]

A map cutscene skip (Map CS Skip) utilizes the quick menu buttons in the top right corner of the UI to open the map at times when it is not usually possible.  This is usually used to skip cutscenes that are otherwise unskippable, but also has some minor other uses as well.



[section=How To]

To perform a Map CS Skip, you must first make sure that under the Feedback menu, the setting Hide Quick Menu Buttons is set to Off.  This will cause menu buttons to appear in the top right corner of the screen.

Before a cutscene starts, you will often be able to see the cursor briefly while the rest of the screen is blacked out.  While the cursor is visible, click any menu button in the top right corner of the screen; while the button is not visible, it is still active.  The best menu to open is almost always the Map screen, which is the second button from the right; however, even if you click a different menu button, you can then move to the Map menu from there.

Once the menu is open, you can use it as normal, including saving, changing equipment, and in some places, modifying your party or returning to the Ebon Hawk.  Most often you will be Returning to the Ebon Hawk to skip a cutscene or other trigger.

[section=Uses]

The main use of Map CS Skips is to skip cutscenes and other triggers by Returning to the Ebon Hawk (and then sometimes Transiting Back).  Examples of this include:

1. The conversation with the Twi'lek when exiting the Taris Hideout after rescuing Bastila
2. Cutscenes when traveling between planets for the first time, including:
* The Sith fighter skirmish and related cutscenes between Taris and Dantooine
* The cutscene with Calo Nord onboard the Leviathan after the first Star Map
* The cutscene with Darth Bandon onboard the Leviathan after the third Star Map
* The cutscene where Bastila is tortured by Darth Malak after flying to Lehon
* Most cutscenes where the MC is having a vision in their sleep
3. The Darth Bandon/Calo Nord fight, when encountered on Korriban
4. Other cutscenes that play when first entering an area (if fast transit is available)

You can also use a Map CS Skip to modify your party, which has one main use and one obsolete use:

1. On the Star Forge, adding party members after defeating Bastila allows you to skip the Darth Malak cutscene when he sets the Star Forge droids on you and subsequently clip through to the elevator.  This is used in No Major Glitches speedruns.
2. When traveling to Davik's Estate, removing Canderous from the party skips the introductory cutscenes with Davik and Calo, and prevents having to fight them as well.  However, in No Major Glitches runs this is slower than skipping the initial conversation with a [Hard Buffer](t5kyf#ch3Hard_Buffers), and Unrestricted runs want to use an [Anywhere Menu Glitch](d4jq8) to skip Davik's Estate entirely instead.
