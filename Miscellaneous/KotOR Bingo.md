[center][big]***The KotOR Bingo Guide
----------------------------***[/big][/center]

[section=Introduction]

The purpose of a bingo run is to take a 5x5 grid of 25 different tasks and complete a row, column, or diagonal of 5 tasks.  Bingo runs require on-the-fly routing decisions and unique character builds, and thus can be more dynamic than a speedrun of a standard category.  Bingo runs are frequently done as races, but can be done solo as a change of pace or just for fun.

[section=Getting Started and Basic Rules]

There are two ways to play KotOR Bingo:

**Method 1 - Bingosync**

KotOR Bingo is now available at [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com/)!  Just visit the webpage and select "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" as your game.  Once you have the room set up, you can share it with others for races or just play the board yourself!

**Method 2 - Downloadable HTML Page**

You can also choose to download and extract the KotOR bingo files from the Resources tab here on SRC.  Running kotor-bingo.html will bring up a webpage that contains a bingo card.  A specific seed can be set, or you can generate completely random cards.

Whichever method you choose, once you've got the bingo app downloaded and ready to go, you're ready to start your run.  Here is an example Bingo card:

https://i.imgur.com/hoLKmb8.png

The goal is to finish a row, column, or diagonal of five tasks.  The idea is that all 12 possible rows are of similar difficulty; but every individual bingo card will have some rows which are at least slightly easier than others.  The goal is to pick the fastest row, and complete it as quickly as possible.

When you're ready to go, load up KotOR and, while on the main menu, generate a new card to use for that bingo run.  If you are timing yourself, you start the timer as you click the "New Card" button.  You stop the timer when you have completed the final task in your row, column, or diagonal.  Note that unlike standard KotOR speedruns, the timer starts *before* Character Creation.  This is because different rows on a bingo card may require different character builds.

**Important Notes:** 
- Typically (and in races), there is a two minute countdown from when the card is generated to when runners can begin creating their characters.  This two minute period is so runners can look over the board and decide at least what their character build should be before starting the run.
- KotOR Bingo runs do not require you to beat the game afterwards; many bingo runs will not reach the Star Forge or even obtain all 5 Star Maps.
- All tasks in your row or column must be complete simultaneously at the end of your run.  You cannot complete a task, then later do something that would "uncomplete" it.  An example is "Light or Dark Side Mastery"; you must still have your chosen Mastery active when you finish your other tasks for it to count.

[section=Choosing a Row]

The most important part of a bingo run is choosing which row, column, or diagonal of tasks to attempt to complete.  This is typically done very early in the run, often before creating your character, as certain tasks require certain character builds.  Different runners have different opinions on how to choose rows; some eliminate certain tasks that they don't want to do and look at what's left; others look for tasks that pair well together; still others look at each row one at a time, and try to determine what would be the fastest.

Deciding which row to pick gets easier the more bingos you do.  If you're not sure at first, just pick the row that sounds like the most fun.  The more you learn about the various tasks on the tasklist, the easier it is to determine which ones you like and which ones you'd rather avoid.

[section=General Task Notes]

Part of bingo is knowing what each task requires.  A task that seems simple may not be so easy; as an example, the "Dominator Gauntlets" task actually requires finishing the Leviathan, and thus is not nearly as easy as the "Circlet of Saresh" task, which just requires access to Kashyyyk.

Below are sections for each general type of task that can appear on a KotOR bingo card.  Each section has general notes for the type of task, then the tasks in that category are listed in alphabetical order with more specific notes where needed.

If you're looking for a task but not sure what category it's in (or just want to find it quickly), I'd recommend using Ctrl+F.  Be aware that some tasks with numbers have an X in place of the number in this list; for example, "8 Different Jedi Robes" would be found under "X Different Jedi Robes".

[section=Item Tasks]

*General Notes:* Any task that simply lists an item, such as "Dominator Gauntlets" or "150 Racing Bonds", requires you to have that item (or items) in your inventory at the end of the run.  These items can be equipped on a character, but you must have access to that character.  Crystals can be placed in a lightsaber, but again you must have access to that lightsaber.

*Specific Tasks:*

**10 Thermal Detonators**
Note that Mika Dorin's special shop on Korriban sells 10 Thermal Detonators, and Bastila has 10 Thermal Detonators if you join her and the dark side on the Temple Summit on Lehon.  Otherwise, these are looted or sold in smaller amounts.

**15 Tach Glands**
This is most easily done by making the tach hostile by agreeing to poach them first.  If you also do the Rulan GenoHaradan quest, there are several more tach that appear there as well.

**150 Racing Bonds**
This requires winning all the Tatooine Swoop Races, completing the "Signing Nico" sidequest for Motta, and Persuading him to give you a bigger reward.

**Bondar Crystal**
This is available in the Crystal Cave on Dantooine or from the Sith Apprentice who shows up in Dreshdae.

**Both Exoskeletons**
These are the Light Exoskeleton and Heavy Exoskeleton, both available from the Yavin shop after collecting a minimum of three Star Maps.

**Both Holocrons**
This is the Sith Holocron found on Lashowe in the Valley of the Dark Lords, and the holocron from Bastila's father's corpse in the Krayt Dragon's Cave on Tatooine.  Remember these must be in your inventory at the end of the run, so you cannot turn in either of them for their relevant quests!

**Carbonite Projector Mark II**
This is obtained from the rogue droid in the Tomb of Marka Ragnos on Korriban, but only if you go through the repair sequence and either disable its programming or cause it to self destruct.

**Circlet of Saresh**
The circlet can be found on the Ritual Beast in the Lower Shadowlands of Kashyyyk.

**Czerka Corp. Resource ID**
This is held by Captain Denho on the Great Walkway on Kashyyyk.

**Damind Crystal**
This held by one of the Dark Jedi who ambush you either in Anchorhead on Tatooine or outside the Wookiee Village on the Great Walkway on Korriban.

**Darth Revan's Robes**
These are only found from the Replicator Bin on Deck 2 of the Star Forge, and could cost as many as 26 Computer Spikes to obtain (less based on Computer Use).  They will also only spawn if you are Dark-aligned.

**Davik's War Suit**
This is unsurprisingly held by Davik Kang in Davik's Estate on Taris.  Note you cannot skip the fight with Davik and Calo if you need to obtain this armor.

**Dominator Gauntlets**
These are available from Mika Dorin's special shop on Korriban after clearing the Leviathan, and cost 22,000 credits.

**Eralam Crystal**
This crystal is held by Dak Vesser, who will recognize Juhani in the Valley of the Dark Lords.  He can then be found in Dreshdae.

**Firkrann Crystal**
The Firkrann Crystal can be found in the Tomb of Tulak Hord or from Lashowe in the Sith Academy.  Lashowe will only have the crystal if you allow her to turn in the holocron herself, and then confront her.

**GenoHaradan Blaster**
This is the reward for turning in the Zuulan bounty to Hulas.  Zuulan can be found in the Matale Grounds of Dantooine after speaking to Hulas the first time.

**GenoHaradan Power Gloves**
This is the reward for turning in the Ithorak bounty to Hulas.  Ithorak appears in the Manaan Docking Bay after speaking to Vek in Ahto East.  This bounty is only unlocked after turning in either Lorgal or Zuulan's bounties.

**GenoHaradan Stealth Unit**
This is the reward for turning in the Vorn bounty to Hulas.  Vorn appears in the Sand People Territory on Tatooine.  This bounty is only unlocked after turning in either Lorgal or Zuulan's bounties.

**GenoHaradan Visor**
This is the reward for turning in the Rulan bounty to Hulas.  Rulan appears in the Upper Shadowlands on Kashyyyk.  This bounty is only unlocked after turning in either Lorgal or Zuulan's bounties.

**ICE Breaker**
This is granted by the Rodian Prisoner on the Prison Block level of the Leviathan in exchange for freeing him from his cell.

**Jenruax Crystal**
This is held by Thalia May in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban or a Dark Jedi inside the Manaan Sith Base.

**Luxum Crystal**
The Luxum Crystal is held by a Dark Jedi Master in the depths of the Manaan Sith Base.  You'll need to gain access to the rear of the base by speaking with Shaelas in Ahto West about the missing Selkath first, or through glitchier means.  It's a challenging fight, so good luck!

**Mantle of the Force**
This is only available from Suvam Tam's shop on Yavin after obtaining all five Star Maps, and costs 25,000 credits.

**Moisture Vaporators**
These appear in the Czerka Office shop on Tatooine after speaking with the Sand People Chieftain.  Remember that you cannot then give these to the Sand People, as you need them at the end of your run.

**Naga Sadow's Poison Blade**
The poison blade is unsurprisingly found in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, on the other side of the light ring puzzle.

**Nextor Crystal**
This can be found on a Dark Jedi on the Great Walkway on Kashyyyk, in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, or on a Dark Jedi on Deck 1 of the Star Forge.

**Opila Crystal**
This can be found in some rubble in the Eastern Dune Sea on Tatooine, or from Jorak Uln in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.

**Phond Crystal**
The Phond Crystal is found on Mekel in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.  Note that you can let Jorak Uln kill Mekel for you.

**Qel-Droma Robes**
These are in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban.

**Raito's Gaderffii**
This is carried by The Storyteller in the Sand People Enclave.  The storyteller will only appear if you appease the Sand People, then bring the Chieftain a Krayt Dragon Pearl.

**Rubat Crystal**
This is only available from two Crystal Formations in the Crystal Cave on Dantooine.

**Sapith and Upari Crystals**
Both of these are available in the Ancient Temple on Lehon; the Sapith Crystal is in Rune-Covered Pillars in both Temple Main Floor and Temple Catacombs, while the Upari Crystal is held by the Sith Master in the Temple Main Floor.

**Ship Parts**
Ship Parts are a quest item on Lehon, and can be found either in the Rakatan Settlement in a cell or underneath the wrecked starship in South Beach.

**Sith Armor**
This is obtained either from the Sith Commander or a party in the North Apartments in Taris.  While it's normally removed from your inventory when you trade it with Gadon Thek, it can be kept for the entire game in the following way:
- Equip it to a party member (usually Carth).
- Make sure Carth isn't in your party when you enter the Bek Base or when you leave Davik's Estate for the Jedi Enclave.

**Sith Medallion**
In order to keep this item, you must Persuade Yuthura to let you in to the Sith Academy, then return to Dreshdae and obtain it from either the Sith Thugs or the Sith Apprentice.

**Sith Power Gauntlets**
These are available from two Dark Jedi or a Sith Master on the Temple Main Floor, with Bastila when turning to the dark side on Temple Summit, or on Deck 2 of the Star Forge.

**Solari Crystal**
The Solari Crystal is found in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban.  You do not have to equip the crystal.

**Star Forge Robes**
These are only found from the Replicator Bin on Deck 2 of the Star Forge, and could cost as many as 26 Computer Spikes to obtain (less based on Computer Use).  They will also only spawn if you are Neutral or Light-aligned.

**Token from Tortured Selkath**
This is the item that Sasha's former friend drops after begging you to warn Sasha about the Sith during the Missing Selkath quest.  Remember you must keep it in your inventory to finish the task; thus you cannot give it to Sasha.

**Two Bendak's Blasters**
Bendak's Blaster is received as the reward for killing Bendak Starkiller in a duel in the Upper City Cantina on Taris.  You can easily duplicate this reward by defeating Twitch, then not talking to Ajuur until you've talked to Bendak to set up the duel.  Talking to Ajuur twice after defeating Bendak will then give you the reward twice, once for Twitch and once for Bendak.

**Two Krayt Dragon Pearls**
This requires eliminating the Krayt Dragon in the Eastern Dune Sea on Tatooine, and then killing Komad Fortuna for the second pearl.

**Verpine Prototype Shield**
This is available from Saul Karath on the Leviathan Bridge, Mika Dorin's special shop in Dreshdae, as a reward for the Invisible Mandalorians quest on Lehon, in a footlocker in the Temple Main Floor, or from Bastila when turning to the Dark Side. 

**Verpine Zal Alloy Mesh**
This is only available as a reward from Warleader Garn on North Beach for killing the Mandalorians in Temple Exterior.

[section=Upgrade Tasks]

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Fully Upgraded..." requires you to obtain the specified item and all upgrades for that item type, then place the upgrades in the item at a workbench.  The item must remain in your inventory (or equipped on an available party member) with the upgrades inside until the end of your bingo.

*Specific Tasks:*

**Fully Upgraded Armor, Blaster, and Sword**
You must have at least one of each fully upgraded.  They do not have to be equipped, just in your inventory.

**All 4 Disguises**

[section=Quest Tasks]

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Complete..." requires you to complete the listed task(s) so that they show in your journal under the "Completed Quests" tab.  Any completion is valid, so long as it shows up in the journal.

*Specific Tasks:*

**X Completed Quests in Journal**
These quests must be actively displayed in the "Completed Quests" section of your journal.  When routing these tasks, be aware that quest data is deleted in four places:
- Taris Quests are deleted when leaving Taris for Dantooine
- Dantooine Quests are deleted when captured by the Leviathan
- Most Midgame Quests are deleted when flying to Lehon
- Most Remaining Quests are deleted when boarding the Ebon Hawk after the events of the Temple Summit on Lehon
Many of these can be skipped either by routing or glitches, but the Taris data is unavoidable.  Thus you likely won't be able to use Taris quests for these tasks.

Either killing him or showing him evidence of the Sith's true nature completes the quest.

**Complete "Hidden Hunters"**

[section=Character Build Tasks]

*General Notes:* Any tasks that lists feats, Force powers, skills, or other character build features must be completed on the main character.  Completing these tasks on a party member does not count.  They also must be permanent; temporarily acquiring them and then losing them (such as during a FLU or via a Hotshot) does not count.

For the purposes of these tasks, *Permanent* means either base points from Attributes or non-timed effects such as equipment or mastery bonuses.  Temporary, timed bonuses such as stims or Force powers do not count for these tasks.

*Specific Tasks:*

**20 Net Stealth Skill**
This is your Stealth skill after all bonuses and penalties are applied.  Temporary effects such as Force Valor do not count towards this task.

**21 Base Charisma**
This requires a full investment of 18 at character creation, and then three attribute levels invested as well.  Thus this requires reaching Character Level 12.  Alternately, you can use glitches to "cook" your character while creating them.

**X Permanent Maximum Vitality**
This will require investment in Constitution or Constitution-boosting equipment and/or the Toughness feats.  Remember that Soldiers and Jedi Guardians get more base Vitality per level.

**X Permanent Maximum Force Points**
This will require investment in Wisdom and Charisma, or effects that boost these stats.  You'll also want to save as many levels as possible for your Jedi class.  Remember that Jedi Consulars get more FP per level than the other Jedi classes.  Light or Dark Mastery may also help.

**X Permanent Points in All Saves**
This will require investment in Dexterity, Constitution, and/or Wisdom for Reflex, Fortitude, and Will saves respectively.  Equipment that boosts one or all saves will also help.  A Scout has better base growths than the other two classes, though the effect may be minimal with only a few levels in that class.

**All Master-Level Blaster Feats**
This includes:
- Master Power Blast
- Master Rapid Shot
- Master Sniper Shot

**All Three Force Immunity Feats**
This task requires being a Jedi Sentinel, as these feats are granted automatically when reaching certain Jedi levels.  The three feats are:
- Force Immunity: Fear (at Sentinel Level 1)
- Force Immunity: Stun (at Sentinel Level 6)
- Force Immunity: Paralysis (at Sentinel Level 12)

**Implant Level 3**
This must be permanently obtained, not temporarily during a FLU or lost with a hotshot.  You do not have to equip an implant to fulfill this task.

**Improved Scoundrel's Luck**
You must get this specific feat; Master Scoundrel's Luck does not count, unless you also get Improved Scoundrel's Luck.  This requires being a Scoundrel at the start.

**Level 6 in Two Classess**
This would be at least level 6 in your starting class (Soldier, Scoundrel, or Scout) and at least level 6 in your Jedi class (Guardian, Sentinel, or Consular).  This level must be permanent; reaching it during a Fake Level Up is not sufficient, and you cannot later lose that level through a Hotshot or other means.

**Master Caution, Empathy, and Gear Head**
All of these require Character Level 8, so this could be done as early as Character Level 10 without using a FLU. This handy task also gets you +3 to all skills!

**Master Toughness and Master Conditioning**
Both of these require Character Level 8, so this could be done as early as Character Level 9 without using a FLU.  This will make your character much tougher to take down!

**Three Third-Tier Force Powers**
Valid Force powers for this task are: 
- Force Armor
- Master Speed
- Master Valor
- Stasis Field
- Destroy Droid
- Force Wave
- Insanity
- Force Storm
- Plague
- Kill

**Three Permanent Immunities/Maximum Permanent Immunities**
There are six total immunities that can be obtained:
- Immunity: Critical Hits
- Immunity: Mind-Affecting
- Immunity: Poison
- Force Immunity: Fear
- Force Immunity: Stun
- Force Immunity: Paralysis
For "Three Permanent Immunities", any three of these are sufficient.  For Maximum Permanent Immunities, note that Immunity: Mind-Affecting covers the same things as Force Immunity: Fear and Force Immunity: Stun, so you can either skip Mind-Affecting or Fear and Stun.  All Force Immunity feats are exclusive to the Jedi Sentinel class.

**Two Weapon Specializations**
This can only be obtained as a Soldier.  One of these must be obtained by reaching level 4 and selecting that feat before changing to a Jedi class.

**Uncanny Dodge 2**
This feat requires starting as a Scout, and is normally granted at level 7.

[section=Kill Tasks]

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Kill..." requires you to kill one or more enemies.  If this task is your last task, timing ends when the final blow is struck.  Some enemies can be killed through a cutscene rather than standard combat.

*Specific Tasks:*

**Defeat Both Defense Droids**
These are the droids that protect the Star Map in the Lower Shadowlands on Kashyyyk.  You must fail the Rakatan Computer's personality quiz to make them appear.

**Defeat Deadeye Duncan**
This is the hardest task possible on the bingo board.  You need to defeat him in a duel in the Upper City Cantina on Taris. Good luck!

**Defeat Malak on the Leviathan**
You must actually defeat both phases of the fight.  Skipping this fight via AMG or other means does not count as completing this task.

**Defeat Twitch**
This is not the streaming platform, but the Dueling Champion in the Upper City Cantina on Taris.  You must beat the previous four duelists before being able to challenge Twitch.

**Kill X Mandalorians**
These Mandalorians count towards this task:
- 11 Mandalorians (*not* including the one Grrrwahrr kills) on Kashyyyk
- 8 Mandalorians (including Sherruk) on Dantooine
- 6 Mandalorians on Lehon
- The imprisoned Mandalorian on Korriban
- Jagi on Tatooine
- Bendak Starkiller on Taris
- Hulas' Mandalorian bodyguard on Tatooine

**Kill a Hive Kinrath**
The Hive Kinrath inhabits the Crystal Cave on Dantooine.

**Kill a Rancor**
The rancor in the Taris sewers counts, even if you use the synthesized odor to make it eat a grenade.

**Kill a Shyrack Alpha**
The Shyrack Alpha is in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.

**Kill an Albino Kath Hound**
The Albino Kath Hound is found in the Sandral Grounds on Dantooine.

**Kill Bastila**
This refers to the battle on the Star Forge.  You must kill her at the end, either through combat or through a cutscene.  If this is your last task, timing ends when the final blow hits in either case.

**Kill Belaya**
Belaya will confront you at the entrance to the Sith Academy on Korriban if you first killed Juhani in the Grove on Dantooine, and then talked to her about it in the Jedi Enclave.

**Kill Calo, Davik, Bandon, and Saul**
Calo and Bandon must be killed when they ambush you on the Star Map worlds; Davik is killed in his estate on Taris, and Saul on the Leviathan Bridge.  Saul does not count as killed until he screams during the conversation after that fight.

**Kill Calo Nord**
This means killing him when he shows up on one of the Star Map worlds; the fight in Davik's Estate does not count since he does not actually die.

**Kill Darth Bandon**
Darth Bandon will ambush you on your next Star Map planet after your third Star Map.

**Kill Four Party Members**
Killing a party member means permanently killing them, not just having them die in combat.  While it is possible to kill six party members total, Bastila can only be killed in the Light Side Star Forge, and it is not possible to kill four party members in the Light Side ending.  Thus the following can be killed for this task:
- *Mission*, on the Central Beach after turning to the Dark Side
- *Zaalbar*, on the Central Beach or on Deck 1 of the Star Forge
- *Jolee Bindo*, in the Temple Summit on Lehon
- *Juhani*, in the Grove on Dantooine or the Temple Summit on Lehon
- *Carth*, on the Star Forge after killing Malak only if a female MC has romanced him first
Usually you won't need to kill Carth unless something goes drastically wrong.

**Kill Four Terentateks**
One terentatek is in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban, two are in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, and one is the Ritual Beast in the Lower Shadowlands on Kashyyyk.

**Kill Griff**
Griff can be killed as soon as he is found in the Sand People Enclave on Tatooine.  Note you must have recruited Mission, talked to her until Lena shows up, and then talked to the Czerka Protocol Officer in the Czerka Office on Tatooine before Griff will be in the Sand People Enclave.

**Kill Hulas**
This can only be done by completing at least four of the five GenoHaradan quests: either Lorgal or Zuulan, and all of Ithorak, Vorn, and Rulan.  Hulas will then ambush you in the Dune Sea.

**Kill Jolee and Juhani**
Juhani can be killed either in the Grove on Dantooine or at the Temple Summit on Lehon when turning to the dark side; Jolee can only be killed at the Temple Summit when turning to the dark side.

**Kill Jorak Uln**
Jorak Uln can be found in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.

**Kill Kandon Ark**
Kandon is one of Brejik's lieutenants, and can be found in the Vulkar Garage.

**Kill Keeper Orsaa**
Keeper Orsaa is in the Elder Settlement in South Beach on Lehon.

**Kill Kel Algwinn**
You must kill him yourself; reporting him to Uthar does not count.

**Kill Saul Karath**
Saul can be found on the Leviathan Bridge, and does not count as dead until he cries out during the conversation after the fight.

**Kill Selven**
Selven is the assassin that the government has a bounty out for on Taris.  She can be found in the Lower City Apartments (West).

**Kill the Lavin Thugs**
These are two Rodians who ambush you outside Kebla Yurt's shop in the Upper City South after you make Gana Lavin mad in the Upper City Cantina.

**Kill The One**
The One is in the Rakatan Compound in North Beach on Lehon.  You only need to kill him, not any of his minions or rancors.

**Kill the Trandoshan Smugglers**
These appear in Suvam Tam's shop after you obtain all five Star Maps and visit his shop at least three times.  You must kill all seven Trandoshans to fulfill this task, but you do not need to talk to Suvam afterwards.

**Kill the Whimpering Locker**
This is done through a conversation with the person inside the locker near the Envirosuit in Hrakert Station.

[section=Clear Tasks]

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Clear..." requires you to eliminate all hostile threats from the listed area(s).  Actions such as disabling sentry droids count as eliminating the threat, unless they are still hostile when you approach them.

*Specific Tasks:*

**Clear a Rakatan Settlement**
This can be either the Warrior Rakata Settlement in the North Beach or the Elder Rakata Settlement in the South Beach.

**Clear Davik's Estate**
This includes fighting Davik and Calo at the end, so make sure you don't accidentally skip that fight.  Gassing guards using the consoles is allowed.

**Clear the Endar Spire**
This includes all 24 Sith soldiers, but killing the final five using the console is allowed.

**Clear the Hidden Bek Base**
This includes both the normally locked areas and Gadon and Kaiera in his office.  Thus you must betray the Beks to finish this task.

**Clear the Hrakert Rift Station**
This includes the main Hrakert Station and the offshoot Kolto Control.  Note that the insane Selkath will calm down and leave if you destroy the kolto harvesting machinery.

**Clear the Leviathan**
This includes the Prison Block, Command Deck, Bridge, and Hangar.  You must kill Saul Karath instead of skipping the fight, and thus must also kill the Sith Grenadiers and Dark Jedi that spawn in the Command Deck on the way out.

**Clear the Manaan Sith Base**
This includes the back section, which can only be accessed after speaking with Shaelas in Ahto West about the missing Selkath youths (or via glitches).

**Clear the Prison Block with Party Member**
This means clearing the Prison Block level of the Leviathan before rescuing the rest of your party in the Detention Cells.  Any of the five available party members are valid, but you must clear out all Sith soldiers and technicians, and the insane Rodian prisoners.

**Clear the Rakatan Temple**
This includes the Temple Main Floor, Temple Catacombs, and Bastila on the Temple Summit.

**Clear the Sand People Enclave**
Note this can be done with or without HK-47.  Make sure you do anything else you need to with the Sand People before attacking them.

**Clear the Shadowlands**
This includes both the Upper Shadowlands and the Lower Shadowlands.  You do not have to make the tach hostile.

**Clear the Sith Academy**
This requires neither Yuthura nor Uthar to return to the academy after the events in the Tomb of Naga Sadow.  You must kill the three Sith who accost you outside the academy as well as everyone in it.

**Clear the Taris Sith Base**
This includes the Assault Droid at the elevator; it cannot be skipped with a glitch.  It also includes the Governor in his office.  The sentry droids can be disabled via Computer Use, and several Sith can be destroyed via Computer Use as well.

**Clear the Vulkar Base**
This includes both the main floor and the Vulkar Garage.  It does not include the normally inaccessible Vulkar Spice Lab, unless you're doing Randomizer Bingo and have the Spice Lab accessible in your settings.

[section=Miscellaneous Tasks]

*General Notes:* These are tasks that don't fit in other categories.

*Specific Tasks:*

This requires recruiting either T3-M4 or HK-47 and getting their corresponding third upgrade class feat.

**Attend Yun Genda's Party**
This requires a female character; you must talk to Yun Genda in the Upper City Cantina to get an invite to his party in the North Apartments.

**Become Sector Champion on Manaan**
For this task you must complete all three races legitimately; skipping them with AMG or by other means does not count.

**Blow Up Matrik's Apartment**
Matrik is in the Lower City Apartments (East).  This requires Persuading him to trust you and then giving him the Permacrete Detonator that's available from Kebla Yurt's shop in the Upper City South.

**Convict Both Rickard and Handon**
This is the best outcome for the "Murdered Settler" quest on Dantooine, given to you by Bolook in the Grove.  You must investigate thoroughly enough to conclude that both suspects tried to kill the victim.

**Defeat Every Pazaak Player Once**
This includes defeating these players:
- *Niklos*, in the Upper City Cantina on Taris
- *Gelrood*, in Javyar's Cantina on Taris
- *Sol'aa*, in the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine

**Discover Zelka Forn's Secret**
This means getting him to reveal to you the Republic soldiers he has been treating.

**Escape the Mind Prison**
This requires completing the riddle minigame within the Mysterious Box obtained from Lurze Kesh on Korriban.

**Exactly 0 Credits**
Remember, this must be true at the end of the run.  Losing money in a Pazaak game is one way to do this.

**Force Choke Lorgal**
You must start the GenoHaradan sidequests by speaking to Senni Vek after obtaining a second Star Map, then Hulas in East Central Ahto City on Manaan.  Lorgal will then appear in the detention area of the Republic Embassy.  Note you must Force Choke him; killing him with Computer Use does not fulfill this task.

**Force Zaalbar to Kill Mission**
This is the scene on the Lehon Beach after reclaiming the title of Dark Lord.  If this is your last task, timing ends when Mission screams.

**Free Hudrow**
Hudrow is Davik's former pilot, and can be found incarcerated in Davik's Estate on Taris.

**Fully Repair HK-47**
This requires recruiting it and succeeding in four successive Repair dialogues with it on the Ebon Hawk.  You'll need 17 net Repair to finish all four.

**Get Banned from Manaan**
You must be banned by the court after the events in the Hrakert Rift, which requires dealing with the Mother Firaxa Shark in either manner, then getting arrested upon returning to the surface.

**Get Dia's Bounty Lifted**
You must learn about Dia's bounty from either Dia or Zax, then either Persuade or pay off Holdan in Javyar's Cantina.  Then tell Dia the good news to complete the task.

**Get Suvam Tam's Pazaak Discount**
This requires winning 10 hands against Suvam Tam on the Yavin Station.  It does not include any other discount.

**Give Griff a Tach Gland**
This requires recruiting Mission, speaking to her until Lena finds you, speaking to the Czerka Protocol Officer, rescuing Griff from the Sand People, then finding Griff in the Czerka Office and giving him a tach gland from the Upper Shadowlands.

**Give Motta the Mysterious Box**
This is the box obtained from Lurze Kesh in Dreshdae after delivering him the spice.  You do not have to open the box to fulfill this task.  Motta can be found inside Swoop Registration on Tatooine.

**Have Sunry Declared Innocent**
This cannot be done without investigating the crime at least partially, and requires three of the five judges to find him innocent.

**Help Three Taris Bounties Escape**
The three bounties you help escape are the following:
- Dia by Persuading or bribing Holdan to drop the bounty (and then telling her about it)
- Largo by giving him 200 Credits
- Matrik by giving him the Permacrete Detonator so he can fake his death

**Help with Lyn Sekla's Audition**
This is the dancing audition in Javyar's Cantina.  You must help Lyn to get the job, not sabotage her.

**Kiss Bastila**
This requires a male character, and refers to the private conversation on the Ebon Hawk at the end of her quest chain.

**Light or Dark Side Mastery**
Keep in mind you must maintain your chosen Mastery until the end of the run.  Having it in the middle and then losing it does not count.  Using exploits to duplicate alignment shifts is allowed.

**Niklos Accuses You of Cheating**
Niklos is in the Upper City Cantina.  You must beat him five more times than he beats you (or 6 times consecutively), then speak to him and he will refuse to play you, calling you a cheater.

**Persuade a Prospective Sith to Leave**
The prospective Sith stand outside the entrance to the Sith Academy near Mekel.  Persuading any of them to leave will fulfill this task.

**Poison Both Yuthura and Uthar**
You do not actually need to see the results of the poisoning, you just have to poison both of them.  This means planting the device on Uthar's bed, and giving the datapad to Adrenas.

**Purchase a Store's Entire Inventory**
The store's inventory must be completely empty; thus no store that sells an infinite amount of an item can qualify for this task.  The only two stores are Adum Larp on Dantooine or Suvam Tam on Yavin.  One of these is cheaper than the other.

**Reach the Star Forge**
If this is your last task, the timer ends in the loading zone after disembarking the Ebon Hawk on the Star Forge.  You do not have to skip the cutscene that occurs immediately afterwards.

**Recruit All Party Members**
They are allowed to be greyed out at the end of the run (unavailable), but you must have recruited them all at some point.

**Recruit HK-47**
It doesn't matter what price you pay for him; you'll find him in the Droid Shop on Tatooine.

**Redeem Ajunta Pall's Spirit**
You must persuade him to return to the light side, not just let his spirit fade away without fighting it.  This option is only available when your character is Light-aligned.

**Redeem X Sith to the Light**
There are six Sith you could redeem:
- *Yuthura Ban*, after befriending her and defeating her in the Tomb of Naga Sadow
- *Ajunta Pall*, in his tomb only if you find his sword and are Light-aligned
- *Mekel*, by being Persuasive after killing Jorak Uln before Mekel dies in the Tomb of Tulak Hord
- *Kel Algwinn*, by being Persuasive in the Sith Academy
- *Dustil Onasi*, by showing him evidence of the Sith's betrayal after triggering his quest through discussions with Carth
- *Bastila*, on the Star Forge
Note that Juhani in the Grove on Dantooine does not count; she is merely a fallen Jedi, not a Sith.

**Rescue Tanis**
This is the hunter in the Dune Sea surrounded by booby-trapped droids.  You must disable enough droids that Tanis survives the encounter and escapes the Dune Sea.

**Rescue the Mandalorian on Korriban**
This is the Mandalorian in the Interrogation room of the Sith Academy.  You rescue him by successfully inducing a catatonic state, so that the Sith discard him and he can later wake up.

**Return Sasha to Dantooine**
Sasha is the stowaway that Zaalbar warns you about on the Ebon Hawk.  You must have recruited Zaalbar on Taris for Sasha to appear.  To return her to Dantooine, spend enough time with her to learn her language and then speak to Lur Arka Sulas in the Jedi Enclave.

**Romance Carth**
This requires a female character, and all of the following actions:
- Speak with Carth 11 times before the Leviathan without alienating him
- Kill Saul Karath and defeat Darth Malak on the Leviathan
- Obtain All 5 Star Maps
- Speak with Carth one more time before entering the Rakatan Temple on Lehon
Done correctly, the "Carth" quest will be completed, and the quest log for it should read:
*There is nothing more that remains to be said. Whatever becomes of you and Carth will have to be determined once your destiny is resolved… one way or the other.*

**Sell Sharina's Wraid Plate**
This must be sold in the Hunting Lodge on Tatooine.  It does not matter how you obtain it.

**Solve the Light Ring Puzzle**
This is the Tower of Hanoi variant in the Tomb of Naga Sadow.  You must actually solve the puzzle; you cannot skip it with a glitch.

**Star Map: Kashyyyk as Revan**
You must gain access to the Star Map through the computer recognizing you as Revan.  This means you should not solve the quiz or fight the defense droids.

**Strand Zaalbar on Kashyyyk**
His portrait should be greyed out on the Party Select Screen at the end of your run.  In order to strand Zaalbar, you must first have recruited him.

**Successfully Interrogate the Sith Prisoner**
This is the prisoner in the Republic Embassy on Manaan.  You must successfully obtain the code to enter the Sith Base from the prisoner.

**Talk to Komad on Kashyyyk**
This requires killing the Krayt Dragon on Tatooine and allowing Komad to leave alive.  He will then appear on the Czerka Landing Port on Kashyyyk.

**Talk to Samnt**
Samnt is Elise's new boyfriend after you deal with her droid fascination.  He can be found in the Jedi Enclave.

**Talk to Yuthura on Dantooine**
This requires befriending Yuthura in the Sith Academy, and then sparing her in the Tomb of Naga Sadow.  She will then appear in the Courtyard on Dantooine, but only if you have not been captured by the Leviathan.

**Win 4 Fighter Skirmishes**
This includes both random skirmishes and plot forced ones (such as the escape from Taris or Leviathan).  You can also use HK-47's simulations to fulfill this task.

**Win All 8 Swoop Races**
This is two races on Taris (to rescue Bastila), three races on Manaan, and three races on Tatooine.  These races must be won legitimately, and cannot be skipped through glitches.

**Zaalbar Wielding Bacca's Ceremonial Blade**
Zaalbar must be an available party member and have Bacca's Ceremonial Blade equipped; he does not actually have to be in your party.
